2. **Identify Sales Patterns**  
   Analyze trends over time by state, segment, and more to plan future strategies.

3. **Strategic Expansion**  
   Use historical sales data by region, category, and state to inform expansion plans.

   Investigate the order-to-ship duration to identify inefficiencies and improvement areas.

5. **Inventory Management**  
   Study inventory distribution and trends to optimize stock levels.

6. **Production Resource Allocation**  
   Identify high-demand products by segment to guide production investments.

7. **Risk Management**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Process

### 1. Data Profiling
- Dataset Size: **2,121 rows**, **21 columns**
- No missing values
- `RowID` column was not sequential

### 2. Data Cleaning
- `RowID`: Re-sequenced and formatted as whole number
- `Sales` & `Profit`: Formatted as decimals
- `Order Date` & `Ship Date`: Formatted as `dd-mm-yyyy`
- `Discount`: Converted to percentage format
- `Postal Code`: Formatted as whole number
- `Quantity`: Formatted as whole number

### 3. Data Transformation
- **Cost** = `Sales - Profit`
- **Unit Price** = `Sales √∑ Quantity`
- **Unit Cost** = `Cost √∑ Quantity`
- **Unit Profit** = `Profit √∑ Quantity`
- **Has_Discount**: Boolean column for discount presence
- **Order-Ship Duration**: Number of days between order and shipping
- **Profit Status**: Flag where `Unit Price < Unit Cost`
- **Date Table**: Created using `CALENDARAUTO()` in DAX  
  - Extracted: `Year`, `Month`, `Quarter` for time-based analysis
